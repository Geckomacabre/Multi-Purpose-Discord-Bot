## Features

### Original Features
These were part of TMCBot before the YAGPDB port.

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Counting** | Sequential number counting game per channel. Tracks high scores, punishes wrong numbers with a random count setback, catches edits/deletes, and responds to natural language queries like "what is the count". Configured with `/config counting`. Buying 💖 **Extra Life** from the shop forgives your next mistake instead of setting the streak back. |

---

### Added Features
Everything below was ported from [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz) and re-implemented in TypeScript.

> **Server configuration** for many features (automod, logging, streaming, welcome, starboard, topic rotation, timezones, free-game tracker, stat channels, and counting) is grouped under a single **`/config`** command with subcommand groups — e.g. `/config automod add`, `/config logs channel`. This keeps the global slash-command count under Discord's 100-command limit. `/config` requires **Manage Server**.

#### Moderation
Each moderation action is its own top-level command. Action commands are hidden from members who lack the matching permission (via default member permissions).

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/ban <user>` | Ban a member. Supports temporary bans (e.g. `1d`, `12h`) that auto-expire. |
| `/unban <user_id>` | Unban a user by ID. |
| `/kick <user>` | Kick a member. |
| `/timeout <user> <duration>` | Timeout a member (Discord native, up to 28 days). |
| `/untimeout <user>` | Remove a member's active timeout. |
| `/warn <user> <reason>` | Warn a member. Warnings are stored and DM'd to the user. |
| `/purge <amount>` | Bulk-delete up to 200 messages. Filter by user, keyword, bots, attachments, or embeds. |
| `/report <user> <reason>` | Report a member to staff. Sends to the modlog channel. Available to everyone. |
| `/case <number>` | View the details of a mod case by number. |
| `/reason <case> <reason>` | Edit the reason for an existing mod case. |
| `/warnings list <user>` | View all warnings for a user. |
| `/warnings delete <id>` | Delete a specific warning by ID. |
| `/warnings clear <user>` | Clear all warnings for a user. |
| `/modconfig modlog [channel]` | Set the channel where mod actions are logged. |
| `/modconfig dm <enabled>` | Toggle whether punished users are DM'd. |
| `/modconfig view` | View current moderation settings. |

#### Raid Detection
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/raidguard recent [minutes] [max_age_days]` | List recently joined accounts, newest first — pulls straight from live member data (not a log, so it works even right after a restart). Defaults to the last 5 minutes with no age filter. |

Also runs automatically: if **5+ accounts under 3 days old** join within a 60-second window, a `🚨 Possible Raid Detected` alert posts to your modlog (or member-log) channel listing everyone involved with clickable mentions and account ages — ready to feed straight into `/ban`. Re-alerts are throttled to once per 5 minutes per server so an active raid doesn't spam the channel.

#### AutoMod
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/config automod add` | Create an automod rule. Trigger types: `spam`, `caps`, `links`, `words`, `mentions`, `regex`. Actions: `delete`, `warn`, `timeout`, `kick`, `ban`. |
| `/config automod list` | List all rules with their ID, status, and config. |
| `/config automod delete` | Delete a rule by ID. |
| `/config automod toggle` | Enable or disable a rule. |

#### Logging
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/config logs channel` | Set the channel for server logs. |
| `/config logs toggle` | Enable or disable logging entirely. |
| `/config logs events` | Choose which events to log: joins, leaves, edits, deletes, bans, nicknames, roles, **commands**. |
| `/config logs ignore` | Toggle ignoring a channel from message logs. |
| `/config logs view` | View current log settings. |

Logged events: member join/leave, message edit/delete, bans/unbans, nickname changes, role changes, and (when enabled) **every slash command used** — who ran it, what command/subcommand/options, and which channel. Handy for tracing what a raid account did before it got banned. Per-category channels (member/message/voice/server/command) can be set individually from the [Web Dashboard](#web-dashboard); `/config logs channel` sets the fallback used when a category has no dedicated channel.

#### Role Management

User commands:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/roles self <name>` | Toggle a self-assignable role on yourself. |

Admin configuration is under `/rolesconfig` (Manage Roles required):

| Command | Description |

| `/rolesconfig self-assign add <name> <role>` | Register a self-assignable role with a name and optional group. |
| `/rolesconfig self-assign remove <id>` | Remove a role command by ID. |
| `/rolesconfig self-assign list` | List all self-assignable roles. |
| `/rolesconfig auto add <role> [delay] [target]` | Assign a role automatically to new members (optional delay; target everyone, humans only, or bots only). |

| `/rolesconfig voice list` | List all voice role bindings. |
| `/rolesconfig reaction add <message_link> <emoji> <role>` | Bind an emoji reaction on a message to a role. |
| `/rolesconfig reaction remove <id>` | Remove a reaction role binding by ID. |
| `/rolesconfig reaction clear <message_link>` | Remove all reaction roles from a message. |
| `/rolesconfig reaction list` | List all active reaction role bindings. |

#### Reputation
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/rep give` | Give +1 reputation to a user (1-hour cooldown per target). |
| `/rep take` | Remove 1 reputation from a user (Manage Guild required). |
| `/rep view` | View a user's reputation. |
| `/rep leaderboard` | Show the top 10 reputation holders. |

#### Tickets
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/ticket create` | Open a new support ticket channel. |
| `/ticket close` | Close and archive the current ticket channel. |
| `/ticket delete` | Permanently delete the ticket channel. |
| `/ticket add <user>` | Add a user to the current ticket. |
| `/ticket remove <user>` | Remove a user from the current ticket. |
| `/ticket panel [channel]` | Post a panel with an **Open Ticket** button in a channel. |
| `/ticket redirect [channel]` | Post a "wrong channel" redirect message pointing users to the ticket channel. |
| `/ticket ratings [user]` | View support ratings for a staff member or the whole server. |

| `/ticket config view` | View current ticket settings. |

#### Reminders
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/reminder set` | Set a reminder (e.g. `10m`, `2h`, `1d`). Fires in the channel where it was set. |
| `/reminder list` | List your active reminders. |
| `/reminder delete` | Delete a reminder by ID. |

#### Custom Commands
Custom commands are managed entirely through the [Web Dashboard](#web-dashboard) — there are no `/cc` slash commands. Supported trigger types: `command`, `startswith`, `contains`, `exact`, `regex`. Responses support `{user}`, `{username}`, `{server}`, `{channel}`, `{membercount}`.

#### Streaming Announcements
Powered by Discord presence detection. Requires the **Presence Intent**.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/config streaming set` | Configure the announcement channel, a role to assign while streaming, and a custom message template (`{username}`, `{game}`, `{url}`). |
| `/config streaming view` | View current streaming settings. |

#### Stream VC — Request to Join
A locked voice channel (e.g. a streamer's private VC). Setting the channel **auto-locks it** (denies `@everyone` Connect). Only members with the configured **required role** (e.g. Self Promo) can request. Each request posts a notice in the **request channel** with a **Review** button; when an approver clicks it, the **Approve/Reject panel opens ephemerally** (only that approver sees it). Approving **unlocks the channel for that member** (grants `Connect`), and the notice updates to show the outcome.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/streamvc request [reason]` | Ask the approvers to let you in (requires the configured role). |
| `/streamvc config set [vc] [request_channel] [required_role]` | Set the voice channel (auto-locked), the channel where requests are posted, and the role needed to request (Manage Server). |
| `/streamvc config panel [channel]` | Post a persistent **Request to Join** button panel members can click (Manage Server). |
| `/streamvc config add-approver <user/role>` | Add a user or role that can review and approve/reject requests (Manage Server). |
| `/streamvc config remove-approver <user/role>` | Remove an approver (Manage Server). |
| `/streamvc config view` | Show the current stream VC settings. |

> The bot needs **Manage Roles/Channels** on the voice channel to lock it and grant access. Make the request channel visible only to approvers so requests stay private. Anyone with **Manage Channels** can always approve, in addition to the configured approvers.

#### Server Stats
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/config serverstats view [hours]` | Show server activity for the last N hours (default 24, max 168). Displays total messages, joins, leaves, and current member count. |
| `/config serverstats channels add <type>` | Create an auto-updating stat channel. Types: `members`, `humans`, `bots`, `channels`, `roles`. |
| `/config serverstats channels remove <id>` | Delete a stat channel by ID. |
| `/config serverstats channels list` | List all stat channels. |

#### AntiPhishing
Active automatically (enabled by default) — no setup required, but everything is toggleable. Three layers of protection, all gated behind a **Manage Messages** staff bypass so mods/admins can still post links freely:

1. **Known phishing domains** — deletes messages linking known phishing sites using the [sinking.yachts](https://phish.sinking.yachts) API. Domain list refreshes every 30 minutes.
2. **Lookalike/typosquat domains** — catches zero-day scam links that haven't hit the blocklist yet (the exact window a raid exploits) by flagging domains within edit-distance 2 of `discord.com`, `discordapp.com`, `steamcommunity.com`, `steampowered.com`, or `epicgames.com` — e.g. `discocd.gift`.
3. **Discord invite links** — auto-removes `discord.gg/*` and `discord.com/invite/*` links, the single most common raid-spam payload.

Every removal posts an alert (domain/code, user, channel) to your modlog channel so you have a record to act on.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/config antiphishing toggle <enabled>` | Enable or disable antiphishing entirely. |
| `/config antiphishing invites <enabled>` | Toggle invite-link auto-removal. |
| `/config antiphishing lookalike <enabled>` | Toggle typosquat domain detection. |
| `/config antiphishing view` | View current antiphishing settings. |

#### Spam Detection
Always active, no configuration needed. Detects and auto-punishes (24-hour timeout + purges the offender's last hour of messages across every channel) any of:
- **Repeated messages** — the *same* message sent 4+ times within 10 seconds (the actual signature of spam bots/copy-paste raids).
- **Flood rate** — 8+ messages in 6 seconds regardless of content, as a safety net for pure flooding. Typing several quick, distinct messages back to back (an enthusiastic chatter, not a spammer) won't trigger this.
- **Cross-channel image spam** — posting images/videos in more than 3 different channels within 10 seconds.
- **Cross-channel message spam** — posting the identical message in more than 3 different channels within 10 seconds.
- **Command spam** — 6+ slash commands in 8 seconds, the signature of a raid script hammering the bot rather than a human clicking through the UI.

Members with **Manage Messages** are exempt (staff/bots running legitimate bulk actions won't get caught). Every trigger posts a detailed report — reason, action taken, and a list of every purged message — to your configured member/message log channels and modlog.

#### Utility
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/ping` | Check bot and API latency. |
| `/avatar [user] [server]` | Get a user's full-size avatar. Use `server:true` to show their server-specific avatar. |
| `/banner [user] [server]` | Get a user's profile banner. Use `server:true` to prefer the server-specific banner. |
| `/userinfo [user]` | Display account creation date, join date, roles, and nickname. |
| `/serverinfo` | Display server stats: owner, member count, boost level, verification level. |
| `/roll [dice]` | Roll dice (e.g. `2d6`, `1d20+5`). |
| `/listroles` | List all roles in the server with member counts. |
| `/viewperms [user] [channel]` | View a user's permissions globally or in a specific channel. |
| `/weather <location>` | Get current weather for a location. Requires `WEATHER_API_KEY`. |
| `/define <word>` | Look up a word's dictionary definition, part of speech, and example. |

#### Random

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/8ball <question>` | Ask the magic 8-ball a yes/no question. |
| `/wouldyourather` | Get a would-you-rather question. |

#### Guessing Games

Four channel-based guessing games — 🎬 **Movie**, 📺 **TV Show**, 🎮 **Video Game**, and 🎵 **Song** — each configured in its own channel. Each round posts with **💡 Hint** and **⏭️ Vote Skip** buttons — the slash commands below do the exact same thing, just pick whichever's faster.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/hint` (or 💡 **Hint** button) | Reveal the next clue publicly for everyone in the channel (up to 5 per round, 6 for songs). Free, but shared — a 60-second cooldown applies between hints (buy ⚡ Hint Rush to skip it), and a correct guess always pays the full XP reward. |
| `/voteskip` (or ⏭️ **Vote Skip** button) | Vote to skip the current round (2 votes needed, locked out for the first 5 minutes so everyone gets a fair shot — a "Vote Skip Available" notice posts once it opens up) |
| `/mediaguess setup <type> <channel>` | *(Admin)* Set up a movie, TV show, video game, or song game channel and start the first round |
| `/mediaguess stop` | *(Admin)* Stop the game in this channel and remove its config |
| `/mediaguess skip` | *(Admin)* Force-skip the current round without a vote |
| `/mediaguess info` | *(Admin)* View configuration and active round status for all four game channels |

The hint sequence is shuffled once per round and shared by everyone — one hint at a time, posted publicly, the same for the whole channel. Hint content adapts per type — movie/TV/game get 5 hints (info card → masked title → anagram → another screenshot → description); songs get 6 (info with year/genre/duration but no artist yet → masked title → anagram → **extended snippet** *(a different 10-second clip, later in the track)* → **artist reveal** → **album art**).

**Movie/TV** — Powered by the **TMDB API** (`TMDB_API_KEY` in `.env`, free at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)). Scene stills come from **MovieStillsDB** (genuine publicity/production stills, no title overlay), falling back to TMDB backdrops. Titles from 1975 to present only.

**Video Game** — Powered by the **RAWG API** (`RAWG_API_KEY` in `.env`, free at [rawg.io/apidocs](https://rawg.io/apidocs)). Only games with a Metacritic score of 60+ are picked, so it's always something recognizable rather than an obscure indie title nobody's played.

**Song** — Powered by **Deezer's public API** — no key needed at all. Rounds post just the **first 5 seconds** of the track as a playable Discord audio attachment (not an image) — the rest is locked behind guessing or the Extended Snippet hint. Once someone guesses correctly, the full 30-second preview posts as a bonus reveal. Pulled from Deezer's charts across a rotating mix of mainstream genres so it's always something current and recognizable, not deep-cuts.

All four suppress repeats per channel for 6 hours.

#### Fun

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/gif <query>` | Search for a GIF using Tenor. Requires `TENOR_API_KEY` in `.env`. |
| `/trivia` | Answer a multiple-choice trivia question with button responses. Powered by OpenTDB (no API key needed). |
| `/freegames now` | Show games that are free right now on Epic Games Store, Steam, and GOG. |
| `/freegames upcoming` | Show upcoming free games on Epic Games Store. |

### Economy & Leveling
These features were added natively to TMCBot (not ported from YAGPDB).

#### Leveling
XP is awarded per message sent (15–25 XP by default, 60-second cooldown per user). Level-up announcements are posted automatically. Leveling up also awards coins as a bonus reward.

Level formula (MEE6-style): `5n² + 50n + 100` XP required per level.
Coin reward on level-up: `level × 50` coins.

User commands:

| 🍀 Lucky Charm | 1.5× gambling winnings for 30 minutes | 30,000 |
| ⚡ Hint Rush | Skip the shared hint cooldown in the guessing games, for 15 minutes | 15,000 |
| 💼 Overtime Permit | Half `/work` cooldown (30 min) for 4 hours | 20,000 |
| 🧲 Coin Magnet | 1.5× coins from `/work`, `/daily`, `/beg` for 24 hours | 40,000 |
| 🎟️ Loaded Dice | Double your chance in the next daily lottery draw | 15,000 |

| 📦 Mystery Box | Instant: 60% coins (2k–8k), 25% a random boost, 10% nothing, 5% 50k jackpot | 10,000 |

#### Drought Bonus
`/work`, `/daily`, and `/beg` each track the last time **anyone in the server** claimed them — not per-user. The longer that sits unclaimed, the bigger the payout grows for whoever runs it next: the reward doubles every 12 hours of drought past a 6-hour grace period for `/work`, every 24 hours past 4 days for `/daily`, and every 6 hours past 3 hours for `/beg`, capped at **1,000,000 coins**. Claiming resets the drought timer back to zero, so hitting the cap takes a server going completely silent on that command for several real days to weeks — rare, but always possible. A boosted claim calls it out in the response (🔥 small bonus → 💰 drought bonus → 🎰 massive/jackpot).

#### Daily Lottery
Once per day, one random server member wins **50,000 coins** automatically. Any member with at least 1 XP (i.e. anyone who has ever chatted) is entered. Buying 🎟️ **Loaded Dice** from the shop doubles your chance for the next draw. Winners are announced in the configured lottery channel — the previous day's winner announcement is deleted right before the new one posts, so the channel never accumulates old winner messages. Enable it with `/economyconfig lottery <channel>`.

#### Free Game Tracker
Polls Epic Games Store, Steam, and GOG every hour for free game promotions. Posts to a configured channel with a claim button, the original price, and how long the freebie lasts. Deduplicates per server so no game is posted twice.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/config freegames setup <channel>` | Enable the tracker and set the announcement channel. Optionally set a role to ping. |
| `/config freegames platforms` | Toggle which platforms to track (Epic, Steam, GOG). |
| `/config freegames ping [role]` | Set or clear the role pinged for new free game alerts. |
| `/config freegames disable` | Disable the tracker for this server. |
| `/config freegames view` | View current tracker settings. |
| `/config freegames check` | Manually trigger a check and post any new free games immediately. |

Supported platforms:
- **Epic Games Store** — weekly free games via their official promotions API
- **Steam** — featured 100%-off specials (free weekends, permanent giveaways)
- **GOG** — discounted-to-free games from their catalog

### Music

Full-featured music player. Supports YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, Apple Music, and more via `discord-player`.

> **⚠️ Music now runs as a separate bot.** The `/music` commands live in a standalone bot under [`music-bot/`](music-bot/), run **natively (outside Docker)**. This is because Discord voice is real-time UDP, and running it under Docker Desktop on Windows/macOS routes it through a virtualized network that adds timing jitter → choppy/skipping audio. Running the music bot natively puts voice UDP directly on the host network and fixes it. The main bot (this project) no longer registers `/music`. See [`music-bot/README.md`](music-bot/README.md) for setup.

**Requires (on the host running the music bot):** `ffmpeg` and `yt-dlp` on PATH. The bot downloads each track's audio with `yt-dlp` and plays it from a local buffer, prefetching the next queued track for seamless transitions.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/music play <query>` | Play a song or add it to the queue. Accepts names, URLs, or playlists. |
| `/music playnext <query>` | Add a song to the front of the queue. |
| `/music playnow <query>` | Play a song immediately, skipping the current track. |
| `/music search <query> [source]` | Search YouTube or SoundCloud and pick a track from the results to queue. |
| `/music stream <url>` | Play a direct stream URL (e.g. an internet radio stream). |
| `/music skip` | Skip the current track. |
| `/music stop` | Stop playback and clear the queue. |
| `/music clear` | Clear the upcoming queue without stopping the current track. |
| `/music pause` | Pause or resume playback. |
| `/music queue [page]` | Show the current queue. |
| `/music nowplaying` | Show what's currently playing with a progress bar. |
| `/music volume <1-200>` | Set the playback volume (persisted per server). |
| `/music speed <0.5-100>` | Set the playback speed of the current track. |
| `/music loop <off\|track\|queue\|autoplay>` | Set the loop mode. |
| `/music shuffle` | Shuffle the queue. |
| `/music remove <position>` | Remove a track from the queue by position. |
| `/music move <from> <to>` | Move a track to a different position in the queue. |
| `/music seek <time>` | Seek to a position (e.g. `1:30` or `90`). |
| `/music karaoke` | Toggle karaoke mode — while enabled, only members with Manage Server can add tracks. |
| `/music summon` | Join your voice channel without playing anything. |
| `/music follow [user]` | Make the bot follow a user between voice channels. |
| `/music clean [amount]` | Delete the bot's recent messages in the current channel. |
| `/music host <user>` | Transfer DJ privileges to another user. |

### Image Editing

57 image manipulation effects ported from [esmBot](https://github.com/esmBot/esmBot), all under a single **`/image`** command. Pick an effect with the autocompleting `effect` option (e.g. `/image effect:blur`, `/image effect:deepfry`). Provide an `image` attachment or a `url`; if neither is given, the most recent image in the channel is used. Effects needing extra input use the `text`, `number`, `font`, or `choice` options (the autocomplete hints which).

Uses esmBot's native C++ image processing addon (libvips). The TypeScript layer is thin — all pixel work runs in compiled C++.

**Build Requirements (Linux/production):**

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
apt install libvips-dev libfontconfig1-dev cmake build-essential

# Then compile the native addon
bun run build:native
```

The `install` script attempts to build automatically. If it fails (Windows dev machine, missing deps), the bot will start but image commands will return an error message prompting you to build the addon.

**Optional features:**
- `WITH_MAGICK=ON` — enables the `magik` effect (content-aware scale); requires `libmagick++-dev`
- `WITH_ZXING=ON` (default on Linux) — enables native ZXing QR code support; requires `libzxing-dev`

All effects below are values for the `effect` option, e.g. `/image effect:blur`. `[number]` effects take the `number` option; `<text>` effects take `text`; `flag`/`watermark`/`uncanny` take `choice`.

#### Color & Filter Effects
`blur` `sharpen` `grayscale` `sepia` `invert` `hue [number]` `deepfry` `jpeg [number]` `vignette` `pixelate [number]`

#### Geometric Transforms
`flip` `flop` `rotate [number]` `crop` `circle` `wide` `squish` `stretch` `tile` `wall`

#### Mirror & Reflection
`haah` `hooh` `waaw` `woow`

#### Distortion Effects
`swirl` `explode` `implode` `magik` `globe` `togif`

#### Animation Effects
`spin` `bounce` `slide` `fade` `reverse` `speed` `slow` `freeze` `unfreeze`

#### Text Overlays
`caption <text>` `caption2 <text>` `meme <text: "top, bottom">` `motivate <text: "top, bottom">` `snapchat <text>` `whisper <text>` `uncanny <text: "left, right">` `uncaption`

#### Meme Generators
`sonic <text>` `homebrew <text>` `spotify <text: song>` `reddit <text: title>` `gamexplain` `scott`

#### Overlays
`flag` — overlay a flag (`choice`: rainbow, trans, pirate, checkered)
`watermark` — brand watermark (`choice`: 9gag, bandicam, deviantart, hypercam, ifunny, kinemaster, avs4you, memecenter, powerdirector, shutterstock)

### Additional Utility

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/base64 <encode\|decode> <text>` | Encode or decode base64. |
| `/status set <message> [type]` | Set the bot's presence/status message (bot owner only). Types: custom, playing, watching, listening, competing. |
| `/status clear` | Clear the bot's status message (bot owner only). |

---

### Context Menus

Right-click (or long-press) a message → **Apps**:

| Menu | Description |
|---|---|
| **Make it a Quote** | Turn the selected message into a stylized black-and-white quote card (grayscale avatar, diagonal top-right fade, M PLUS font). Resolves mentions and renders `**bold**`/`*italic*`. Includes a "Remove my Quote" button. |
| **Select Image** | Pick an image from the selected message to use with the next `/image` command — handy when the target image isn't the most recent one in the channel. |

---

## Database

TMCBot uses a local SQLite file (`db.sqlite`) managed automatically on startup. No external database is required.

---

### Web Dashboard

A YAGPDB-style dark-themed web panel for managing all bot settings without slash commands. Starts automatically with the bot when `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` is set.

**Setup:**
1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) → your app → **OAuth2 → Redirects**
2. Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (or `WEB_URL/auth/callback` for production)
3. Add `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`, `WEB_PORT`, and `WEB_URL` to your `.env`
4. Ensure port 3000 is exposed (already set in `docker-compose.yaml`)
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` and log in with Discord

**Config pages:** Economy · Leveling & Level Roles · Welcome · Starboard · AutoMod · Logging · Reaction Roles · Giveaways · Topic Rotation · Birthdays · Timezones · Stat Channels
